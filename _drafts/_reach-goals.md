## Why “Do something”



## The 5-step process and how it works

- **Establish clear priorities** of what you truly want to do (it must fit into your daily schedule, or it’s probably not a huge priority)
- **Design your daily routine** to ensure you get it done optimally
- **Use the** [**Pomodoro Technique**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) — where you work for a set period of time without any distractions
- **Report your progress** immediately after you’ve completed your session
- **Have a weekly reflection** where you assess your progress and make future plans



## Morning routine
The first thing you do in the morning is reflective of how the rest of your day will go. If you start right, your chances of continuing to have a solid day are very high. 



## Concluding notes

Success isn’t as hard as it appears. It’s not that far away. Success simply requires:

- Prioritization
- Planning
- Execution
- Accountability
- Reflection and improvement

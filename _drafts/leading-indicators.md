## Why do <the play>

## play content
Phase One requires the development of new forms of measurement, using leading indicators that measure validated learning. Leading indicators come in many forms but their common purpose is to track signs that the process is working at the team level. This could include showing development of a faster cycle time, or increased customer satisfaction and engagement.

New metrics will be needed to measure these indicators; the key here is to keep the metrics simple and focused on validated learning. One example, taken from an IT division, might have just four metrics to measure the success of a new project:

- How fast can a team get a new task done?
- How many tasks can a team complete in the course of one work cycle?
- How long does it take a task pulled out of the production backlog to get back into production?
- How long does a task sit in the backlog?

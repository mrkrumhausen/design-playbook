# Product Development Process


### Planning (Step 0)
- List of opportunity & problem areas

- [ ] Set up War room

### Research
- Innovation Brief: Every project starts with a concise innovation brief that addresses the challenge at hand. What is the desired future and what keeps us from getting there? Creating a brief takes thorough questioning, but when well-formulated it gives focus and flow throughout the project.

- Discovery: Convert findings into actionable knowledge. Findings are generalised in insights, and insights are combined into opportunities. 

- Jobs to be done: How do we serve our customers’ most important and least satisfied needs?
- Stakeholder interviews (Sourcing Creative Ideas From Your Team)
- SWOT
- Trends


### Step 1: Generating

Vision: After the research, we set the stage for designing concepts. Central to this is a concise vision; an informed statement on how we can defy the status quo. The selected opportunties provide actionable starting points to start developing ideas.

### Step 2 Screening
- go/no go
- Meet specific criteria
- Relevant questions:
    - Which ideas address the brief the strongest?
    - Which ideas are compelling and unique?
    - Can any of these ideas be combined?
    - What do these ideas have in common?
    - Can any of these ideas be simplified?
    - How can these ideas better address the brief?
    - What is the strongest and weakest part of each idea?

- [ ] Create printed template for new ideas

### Step 3/4 - Detailing

- 

#### Step 3/4 - Get feedback

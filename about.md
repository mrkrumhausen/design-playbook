## What is The Product Space ðŸš€
The product space is a playbook of product management techniques and best practises. It consists of plays gathered from different sources incl. frameworks, talks, blog posts, resources and books.

## What is a playbook?
In American football, the situation on the field changes all the time. Itâ€™s impossible for a team to plan all their moves in advanceâ€Šâ€”â€Šthey have no clue how things are going to unfold. To cope with this uncertainty, teams use so-called playbooks which contain the teamâ€™s strategies and plays.

## What is a play
A play is an agreed upon set of actions the product team can choose in a given situation. It helps to have a shared understanding and a shared language, so everyone is on the same page.

## Why playbook?
The playbook will enable us to:

- Document and teach how you build products
- Provide shared language and understanding
- Understand

Thinking in terms of a playbook allows you to to embrace continual improvement since you can always remove old plays that no longer work and continuously add new ones as they are created. Playbooks only require teams to use the plays that work for them in their situation

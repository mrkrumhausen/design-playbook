## When to run: Customer Journey Mapping?

Understand the user’s journey before you start building. 



## Why Customer Journey Mapping?

To create a complete overview of what customers want, what triggers them and what pain points they face 

You need to understand the way they approach your product, the touch points, their frustrations, and the pain points. Listening to your customer’s experiences gives you a scope to fine-tune your product’s experience.

Having a good understanding of your customer’s journey helps you gain benefits like:

1. Having a big picture of your customer’s journey
2. Making collaboration between design, tech, and business groups easy and effective
3. Optimise the user experience by identifying and addressing the negative user experience
4. Optimised conversion funnel as you worked on friction points
5. Identify the customer leak points, address them, and get the opportunity to bring them onboard again
6. Better customer experience journey designing

## Concluding notes

The Customer journey map can help you significantly improve the customer journey even before you start prototyping it. It helps you think from your user’s perspective and visualise the friction you have in experience. Addressing these issues helps you create a super awesome product that your real customers want to use.



- The Customer journey map in itself is not the goal. What are you trying to achieve?
- CJM is a process not a tool.

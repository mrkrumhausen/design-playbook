## Product Roadmap Template
Getting a handle of the roadmap is critical not only for you to do your job, but also for your entire team.

## Q1: Theme, date range
A short description of the themeâ€”typically centred around company or product growth goals
- Base it on the quarterly OKRs

## Feature Milestones
A list of product features that will define success for this quarter

## Customer Success Milestones
A list of customer features that will define success for the quarter

## Growth Goals
A list of growth numbers we are trying to hit

## Concluding notes
Repeat as needed for each quarter. Your goal should be to have the next quarter as tight as possible, with the next quarter being broad strokes, and two quarters out being even broader. Tighten as time goes so you can react to changes.

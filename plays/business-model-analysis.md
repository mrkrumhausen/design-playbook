Fill in the business model canvas

## Understand the how the business operates
After completing a Business Model Canvas for a current or future business model, you can ask the following questions:
- Where are our revenues coming from?
- What value is delivered to which markets?
- What costs are involved in delivering that value?
- Are our perceived key activities and key resources as important for gaining revenue as we think they are?
- If we change our model in a specific way, what are the effects?

## More things to review
- Review the customer journey
- Review the full supply chain

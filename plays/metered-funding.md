## When to run

## Why

## play content
Metered funding gives teams the freedom to spend the money, with strict criteria that must be met to unlock more, and an emphasis on validated learning. It enforces a scarcity mindset, is conducive to cross-functional collaboration, and reduces middle-management interference. To be most effective, metered funding should be paired with growth boards â€“ groups of people to whom the teams are accountable and that sign off on the next round of funding. This creates a direct relationship between the financing of a project and its progress.

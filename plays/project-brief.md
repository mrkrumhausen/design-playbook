## The Project Brief
A good application and project description must provide a clear picture that the project can be realised and run in a sustainable manner.

To get from the idea to the actual description of a defined and sustainable project with clear phases, goals and concrete activities, a number of tools are available that the project manager and project group can benefit from.


## Why write a Project Brief
help you conduct a well-controlled project which is carried out within the agreed scope, time and budget.

## 1. Project goal
*Describe the goal of the project. Imagine you could print out in big letters, neon light, blinking, one or two sentences for why we need to do this, what is it we are trying to achieve, what would you then write*? 

### 1.1 KPIs
How do we track the success of the completed project?

## 2. Project Description
*In this chapter you describe briefly what we currently have (A) and what we are moving to (B) and what's the work we need to do in the project, to move from A to B.*

### 2.1 Current situation
*Describe the current situation*.

### 2.2. New solution
*Describe the new situation/solution we want to move toward*

### 2.3 Getting from current situation to new solution
*Here you describe (or an illustration could also do) what are the work we need to do in the project, to move from A to B. Keep it high-level, don't go into small details*. 

## 3. Project delivery breakdown
#### 3.1 Project deliveries
a breakdown of the deliverables

#### 3.2 Associated project delivery description

## 4. Project Organisation
### 4.1 Project Team
*Completes the deliverables within the project scope. If the team needs a change in scope, time or cost, the Project Manager has the responsibility to take this decision to the Steering Group.*

### 4.2 Steering Group
*Takes the necessary decisions with regards to scope, time and cost and determine how the project will proceed and overcome its problems.*

### 4.3 Relevant Stakeholders
Other groups (or major stakeholders)

## 5. Timelines
### 5.1 Overall project phases
### 5.2 High-level timeline
Could be a high-level timeline with associated milestones or a in a more agile setting, sprints.

### 5.3 Risks

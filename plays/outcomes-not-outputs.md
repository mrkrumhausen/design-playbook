## Outcomes not Outputs
One of the biggest traps in product planning is focusing on outputs over outcomes — that is, discussing what to build before clearly defining its purpose.

Many apps and websites fail because they solve problems that nobody cares for.  Before you decide on specific products and features, you should know the problem you need to address. Otherwise, you’re taking huge risks in building the wrong things.


## Objective based product development
Management will provide the overall objective for each quarter - OKR. The objective is outcome based (e.g. increase leads or increase retention) rather than delivery based (e.g. build a specific feature).

NB: *Outcome-based objectives are fundamental to Dual-Track Agile product development*.

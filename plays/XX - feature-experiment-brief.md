# Feature/experiment brief
Writing a good brief is a fundamental step to draw a common understanding from a mix of inputs, vision, strategy, constraints and ideas that typically precede product development.



## Objective
Align effort with business goals to make sure everyone is onboard.
- Define the problem you are solving

## Hypothesis (KPIs)
- The Why: How do you know that is a real problem
- Define "Success" - How will you know you've solved it
- List metrics and goals that measure the success of the feature.

## Experiment design
Description of the solution/implementation.

- Clearly define the "What" - Define the problem you are solving
- What's in scope / out of scope for your next cycle

## What problems do we need to solve?
Identify unknowns, areas of risk, and known challenges that need to be resolved before development can begin.

## What have we already built?
A short description of existing and related features that give context to the new project.

## Results

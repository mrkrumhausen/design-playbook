# Jobs to be done
*Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) is a framework based on the idea that whenever users “hire” (i.e., use) a product, they do it for a specific “job” (i.e., to achieve a particular outcome).*

Rather than focusing on a list of features for a product, the JTBD framework forces designers to think about outcomes. It helps you understand that customers don’t buy products and services; they hire various solutions at various times to get a wide array of jobs done.

When you see customers piecing together solutions themselves, these are great clues for innovation.


### What isn’t a Job to be Done
- A big mistake is thinking of a Job to be Done as an activity or task. Examples include *store and retrieve music* or *listen to music*. These are not Jobs; rather, they are tasks and activities — which means they describe how you use a product or what you do with it


### a better me
Instead a Job to be Done describe the “better me.” It answers the question, “How are you better since you started using [product]?”

*Upgrade your user, not your product. Don’t build better cameras — build better photographers*.

Customers don’t want your product or what it does; they want help making themselves better (i.e., they want to evolve, make progress).


### Example
*Free me from the stress I deal with when figuring out what products won’t harm my children so I can have more time to enjoy being a parent*.

Note the two parts: (1) the Job, (2) when the job is done

The emphasis on a struggle for progress is why this JTBD model often makes use of phrases such as give me, help me, make the, take away, free me, or equip me. These phrases remind us that success comes from the customers using the product to make progress. It also helps you think about how your product fits in between where they are now and where they want to be.


### Job story
All about context and causality.

**Examples**

When an important new customer signs up, I want to be notified, so I can start a conversation with them.

When I’m in a rush, starving, need something I can eat with one hand while ‘on the go’, am not sure when the next time I’ll be able to eat, …

### user stories

As a _____ , I want to _____ , so I can _____ .

Example:
*As a tea drinker I want to pick up my tea by a handle, so that I don’t burn my hands*.

User stories can be broken down if needed:
- *As a tea drinker, I want my tea in a mug so that I can pick it up*.
- *As a tea drinker, I want my mug to have a handle so that I don’t burn my hands*.

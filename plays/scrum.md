# SCRUM

## What is Scrum?

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. Much like a rugby team (where it gets its name) training for the big game, Scrum encourages teams to learn through experiences, self-organize while working on a problem, and reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve.



## The Sprint

A sprint is the actual time period when the scrum team works together to finish an increment. Two weeks is the typical length for a sprint



## Scrum Ceremonies or Events

Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve.

Below is a list of all the key ceremonies a scrum team might partake in. All the events ‚Äî from planning to retrospective ‚Äî happen during the sprint.



**NB: If you're kicking off a new project** then read the [project brief + project kickoff](/plays/project-brief) play first



### 1 Sprint planning

Figure out how we actually do the work and agree the order we‚Äôll work on it. It‚Äôs an opportunity to talk through the tasks required, challenge any previous assumptions, including estimates, and check that stories and acceptance criteria are really ready for development.

- **Attendees**: Scrum Team, including shared resources
- **Duration**: 2 hours, based on a 2 week sprint
- **Frequency**: Once per Sprint; first day of the Sprint



#### Inputs for Successful Planning

- Ordered (Prioritized) Product Backlog 
- What was completed in the last Sprint/Product Increment 
- Past performance of the Development Team (Velocity) 
- Development Team capacity for the Sprint



#### Topics for Planning Discussion 

- What will be done in this Sprint? Product Backlog Items (PBIs) to select from the Product Backlog to create a Product Increment.This is solely the decision of the Development Team. The selected PBIs influences the Scrum Team in defining the Sprint Goal. 

- How to do the selected work to get it done?  Knowing the Goal, the Development Team decides how to build the functionality into a ‚ÄúDone‚Äù Product Increment.  The Development Team defines the tasks it needs to complete the Product Increment; tasks are decomposed into small pieces of a day or less. 



#### Outcomes

- Sprint Goal and what will be completed (PBIs) 
- How the work will be done (Plan) 
- Sprint Backlog



**Agree on the sprint backlog**: Allocate tokens (e.g. poker chips or matches) to each team member to represent the number of hours they have available in the sprint.

**The sprint goal**: The sprint goal is set by the PO and is a short encapsulation of what the team has agreed to achieve during the sprint. Examples: *Build a responsive homepage with navigation menu and Twitter feed*.



### 2 Daily scrum / Standup
**Attendees**: The Scrum Team, including shared resources and any interested parties: however, only Scrum Team members provide updates. 

**Duration**: 15 minutes. 

**Frequency**: Every day of the Sprint

**Objective**: Inspect and adapt to further progress toward the Sprint Goal 

This meeting is also called a "daily stand-up" emphasizing that it needs to be a quick one. The stand up is the time to voice any concerns you have with meeting the sprint goal or any blockers



#### Structure

 Each Development Team member will answer each question every day: 

- **Yesterday**: What did I do yesterday to help meet the Sprint Goal? 
- **Today**: What will I do today to help meet the Sprint Goal? 
- **Blockers**: What impediments do I have that are blocking me (or the Development Team) from meeting the Sprint Goal? 

After the time-boxed Scrum, Team members can continue detailed discussions to answer questions, solve problems, refine the design, or adapt the remaining Sprint work. 



### 3 Grooming / Backlog refinement (optional)

The objective of the *Backlog refinement meeting or Grooming session* is to get enough of the product backlog ready to comfortably populate the next sprint backlog. 



**Attendees**: The Scrum Team, including shared resources and Subject Matter Experts if needed 

**Duration**: 1‚Äì4 hours, depending on the Sprint length 

**Frequency**: Once per Sprint, usually after the midpoint of the Sprint 

**Objective**: Inspect and Adapt the Product Backlog and PBIs to ensure targeted PBIs are ready for the next Sprint 



#### Topics covered

- PO presents the ordered backlog and identifies PBIs they‚Äôd like in the next Sprint 
- Development Team asks questions and requests additional details if needed 
- Any PBI that has enough information is sized by the Development Team in the session 

*Sizing could entail breaking a PBI into user stories that can be tackled in a single sprint, agree on acceptance criteria for those stories and, often, to estimate them (normally by attributing story points).*



#### Output

- List of PBIs for clarification and the questions that need to be answered 



### 4 Sprint demo / review

The sprint demo is invaluable for keeping stakeholders up to speed with the progress of product development. It allows them to feedback and suggest improvements that can added to the product backlog to maximise value.



**Attendees**: The Scrum Team, including shared resources, and Stakeholders Duration: 1‚Äì4 hours, depending on Sprint length 

**Frequency**: Once per Sprint, usually on the last day of the Sprint; it‚Äôs the next-to-last event in the Sprint 

**Objective**: Collaboratively inspect the Product Increment and adapt the Product Backlog 



#### Structure

The Sprint Review is meant to be an informal collaboration on the current Product Increment and
 to collectively update the Product Backlog with information from the Stakeholders that may influence the Backlog contents. 



#### Topics covered

- PO provides an overview of the Sprint Goal and the PBIs that were selected. 
- Development Team demonstrates the Product Increment and answers questions. 
- PO shares the Product Backlog and the projection of completion based on current progress. 
- PO facilitates open discussion with the Stakeholders, capturing feedback and outside information that may help the Scrum Team. 
- PO adds appropriate feedback into the Backlog. 

*While demoing the sprint work, user stories provide a good framework to report on which work has been done and what remains to be done.*



#### Release notes template

If your team is sending out release notes

- **tl;dr**: Sometimes readers just want a quick summary.
- **Released**: A more detailed explanation of each feature, where to find it, how to use it, etc.
- **Fixed/Updated**: If bugs are part of the release, quick and to-the-point notes are essential to communicate.




### 5 Retro
Run a retrospective at the end of a sprint. It is a forum for the team to come together and discuss successes, failures, learnings, and note down anything that will be useful in the future. It's a cathartic exercise designed to help teams and companies continuously learn and improve.

*NB It's worth nothing that retrospectives are not an appropriate platform for personal feedback. This should be done separately in one-to-one sessions*.



**Attendees**: The Scrum Team, including shared resources if they‚Äôve been working on the Team in the Sprint 

**Duration**: 1‚Äì3 hours, depending on Sprint length

**Frequency**: Once per Sprint, this is the last event in the Sprint

**Objective**: Inspect and Adapt the Team‚Äôs processes; select items for focused improvement 



#### Structure

**Continue**: Things that went well

- What went well?
  Why did it go well?
  		How do we keep encouraging that?

**Stop**: Things that didn't go so well

- What went badly?
  Why did it go badly?
  		How do we avoid repeating that?

**Start**:

- What should we start doing?



#### Topics covered

- Inspect how the last Sprint went in regard to people, relationships, collaboration, processes, and tools. 

- Create an ordered list of major items that went well and those that could be improved. 

- Create a plan for implementing selected improvements to how the team works. 

  The Scrum Master ensures the event takes place and is well-facilitated. Scrum Master also ensures the timebox is adhered to. As the process owner, the Scrum Master is an active participant in the event. 



### BONUS: Weekly recap email

Send email digest of the previous week to our team and advisors.

One of the biggest benefits of documenting each week is it provides a history that new hires can browse at their leisure to get a better understanding of how the team got to the present.

1. **Dev sprint wrap-up/kick-off**: Depending on the week (we work in two week sprints), I‚Äôll provide a brief overview into what work we just delivered or just started working on.

- If you manage more teams you can add separate updated for those, e.g growth/marketing, Sales, PR

1. **The rundown**: Any day to day activity or updates that fall outside of sprint work. Dave, my partner and CEO also includes detailed notes on the following areas:

- Growth
- Fundraising
- Hiring

1. **Customer feedback**: This is a great way to keep the team up-to-date on what is and isn‚Äôt working with the product.
2. **Upcoming milestones**: Bullet list of growth and roadmap milestones
3. **What are we reading**: We keep a #reading-list Slack channel. If anything pops up there that‚Äôs worth an extra look, it gets captured here as well.

**Pro Tip**: for more details about weekly recaps, read the [six templates for product managers][templates]



### Bonus: Product Roadmap refinement

Make sure your quarterly roadmap is up to date and you have broken it down into smaller product or experiment briefs



üëâ Review the backlog and prioritise the user stories based on urgency.

**Populate the backlog**: At this stage the user story only needs to describe the feature in broad brush strokes

**Refining the backlog**: Fleshing the stories out. Refine the backlog with, as a minimum, the ‚ÄòThree Amigos‚Äô ‚Äì the Product Owner, a developer and a (UX) designer.



**Pro tip**: Backlog refining can be done as part of the discover track in [Dual-track scrum](/plays/dual-track-scrum)

Below is a list of team rituals that are beneficial for running a development team.

## Review the product roadmap and backlog
Make sure your quarterly roadmap is up to date and you have broken it down into smaller product or experiment briefs
- Review the backlog and prioritise the user stories based on urgency.

## Weekly recaps
Send email digest of the previous week to our team and advisors.

One of the biggest benefits of documenting each week is it provides a history that new hires can browse at their leisure to get a better understanding of how the team got to the present.

1. **Dev sprint wrap-up/kick-off**: Depending on the week (we work in two week sprints), I’ll provide a brief overview into what work we just delivered or just started working on.
- If you manage more teams you can add separate updated for those, e.g growth/marketing, Sales, PR

1. **The rundown**: Any day to day activity or updates that fall outside of sprint work. Dave, my partner and CEO also includes detailed notes on the following areas:
- Growth
- Fundraising
- Hiring

1. **Customer feedback**: This is a great way to keep the team up-to-date on what is and isn’t working with the product.

1. **Upcoming milestones**: Bullet list of growth and roadmap milestones

1. **What are we reading**: We keep a #reading-list Slack channel. If anything pops up there that’s worth an extra look, it gets captured here as well.

## SCRUM rituals
### Daily standup
At 4:30pm, Our slack plugin sends a message to the #stand-up channel and the team updates everyone on their accomplishments for the day and focus for tomorrow. This allows us to share links to mockups or tickets we are working on and gives the team time to process blocking issues more easily.

- **Today**: A list of what you got done today.
- **Tomorrow**: A list of what you plan to work on tomorrow.
- **Blocking**: A list of blocking issues and @-replies to anyone who can help

### Grooming
### Planning
### Demo day
The sprint demo is invaluable for keeping stakeholders up to speed with the progress of product development. It allows them to feedback and discuss with possible amendments to the Product Backlog which would help to maximise value.

#### Release notes
A standard SCRUM sprint is two weeks with one or more release. Sticking to a template will allow you to work faster and more efficient.
- **tl;dr**: Sometimes readers just want a quick summary.
- **Released**: A more detailed explanation of each feature, where to find it, how to use it, etc.
- **Fixed/Updated**: If bugs are part of the release, quick and to-the-point notes are essential to communicate.


### Retro (optional)
Run a retrospective at the end of a sprint. It is a forum for the team to come together and discuss successes, failures, learnings, and note down anything that will be useful in the future. It's a cathartic exercise designed to help teams and companies continuously learn and improve.

*NB It's worth nothing that retrospectives are not an appropriate platform for personal feedback. This should be done separately in one-to-one sessions*.

**Continue: Things that went well**
-		What went well?
-		Why did it go well?
-		How do we keep encouraging that?

**Stop: Things that didn't go so well**
-		What went badly?
-		Why did it go badly?
-		How do we avoid repeating that?

**Start:**
- What should we start doing?

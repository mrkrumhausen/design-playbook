## How to Validate your startup idea?
Nothing is more frustrating than spending years on your idea just to notice it wasn’t any good in the first place.



Four things are critical for success: the idea, the product, the team and the execution.





## Why validate your idea?
Innovation is hard work. You’re literally trying to create something that doesn’t exist!
There are no guidelines, no working templates, no business models to clone. There’s nothing. You’re on your own! It’s just you and your imagination. With those odds of course 90% of people and companies fail!

## Questions to ask before starting a business



### 1. Product fit

1. **What problem are you solving?** Solve a real problem for your users. If you can’t clearly state the problem your product or service solves, you probably don’t have a successful idea. 
2. **What niches have not been served/what gaps exist in the market?** Try to understand what problem in the market you are trying to address or if there are gaps or niches that are not being served by anyone else. If those areas intersect with what you like, then you have hit the sweet spot.
3. **What are customers “hiring” today?**

*From the jobs-to-be-done framework*.

If you have found a problem worth solving, then people are already solving it somehow (seriously, if your customers are doing nothing to solve the problem, then maybe it is not
a problem worth solving). Anyway, often they already pay something to someone at some stage of the current solution. To whom do they pay and how much?



1. **How have others attempted to solve this problem before, and why did their solutions succeed or fail?** There’s a lot you can learn from those who have gone before you.

2. **How many specific benefits for your product or idea can you list?** The more you can think of, the more likely it is that you’re meeting a real need and can be successful.

3. **Can you state, in clear language, the key features of your product or service?** Not being able to easily describe the key features of your idea is a warning sign that the idea isn’t well thought out yet.

4. **What key features does my product or service have that others will have a hard time copying?** Before you go into business, you need to be very clear about what sets you apart from competitors.

5. **How will I test and validate the product idea?** [Test your idea](/plays/mvp). If it works with the target audience, you can go ahead else it’s still not too late to go back to the drawing board. 

   

### 2. Market fit

1. **What is the target market for my business?** Neither is every product meant for everyone nor do companies have the time and resources to reach everyone. Zeroing in on the [target market](https://www.feedough.com/target-market-definition-examples-strategies-analysis/) not only helps you set your marketing and development strategies in place, it also can lead to higher returns on investment in the long run.
2. **What is the market size?** What is the current size of the market? What is the potential size of the market? Will it grow or contract? Why? How much of the market share can we conservatively take? Understanding how many people need your idea -- and what they’re willing to pay for it -- will help you determine whether your concept is viable.
3. **What are the market price points?** What kind of margins should we expect in this market?
4. **What is my market demographic?**
5. **Who are my market competitors?** Having competitors isn’t a bad thing -- it means a market exists. However, knowing what you’ll face if you launch is important, as an overcrowded marketplace or one where consumers have a strong affinity for the dominant brand may be more difficult to break into.
6. **Is the business idea scalable? If not, how do I make it scalable?** For a business to be scalable means you being ready to handle increasing number of customers and vendors. Businesses need to grow to become successful. If you can’t see growth for your business in the future, then you must ask yourself what changes to its business model shall make it scalable and help it grow.



### 3. Revenue
1. **Revenue model** Where do you get your money? And what is the model of getting that revenue: monthly subscription, one-time fee, pay-per-use...?
2. **What will it take to break even or make a profit?** Some ideas take a lot of upfront investment, while others don’t. If yours does, it’s a good idea to plan for how you’ll handle your finances and daily needs while you’re waiting for your product or service to gain traction.



### 4. Effort

1. How much cash will I have at risk?
2. How much time will it consume?
3. Can I test-run the business part-time before quitting my job?
4. How many employees will I need?
5. How will I exit my business few years down the line if I want to and how will the responsibilities be transferred in such a case?



### 5. Bonus: What investors are looking for

1. Team
2. Total addressable market
3. Technology (Rocket science)
4. Transformative
5. Ten x (10x)

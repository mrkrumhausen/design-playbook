## How to Validate your startup idea?
Write your intro here

## Why validate your idea?
Innovation is hard work. You’re literally trying to create something that doesn’t exist!
There are no guidelines, no working templates, no business models to clone. There’s nothing. You’re on your own! It’s just you and your imagination. With those odds of course 90% of people and companies fail!

## 6 questions to ask before starting a business
1. What is my market size
2. What are the market price points?
3. What is my market demographic?
4. What is the need of this market?
5. Where are the market communities?
6. Who are my market competitors?

## Experiment your way to success
You should run experiments to assess the value of an idea. An idea often comes as a solution to a user’s “pain”/need.

Inside organisations, we often listen to senior managers as the main source of information.

## Why experiment?
In all companies I have ever been in (from startups to enterprises), there have been plenty of ideas. The problem is to figure out what the best idea is, and spend the time on that.

Why can’t we just ask people or interview them? Well, people often do not behave the way they say they do.

…Instead validate your idea (and learn) in the fastest, cheapest way possible.

## The Traditional way assessing ideas
*Idea > Business Case > Senior Decision > Build > Measure success*

In this model, a committee has to decide (with their knowledge and assumptions) if an idea is good after an innovation team presents their desktop research.

We don’t know if the committee members have sufficient knowledge. And neither do they. It is all based on their assumptions and experiences. As markets move fast, their knowledge and assumptions might be obsolete.

Working on a business case early in an idea assessment process is based on pure guesses. While it is beneficial to bear costs and benefits in the back of your mind, I have done many long and impressive business cases in my time to satisfy a need for numbers in a scenario about which we know almost nothing

The result is that the people working on an idea often get attached to it, making it harder to kill.

## The experimental approach
In the experimental approach, we try to run simple experiments as fast as possible in order to learn if something is a good idea. Here the focus is on testing / failing fast

*Idea > Measure (experiment) > Senior decision > Build*

When you have run experiments and gained knowledge about an idea, this is the time to include senior management. Now they have real market data on which to base their decisions.

## Focus on outcomes, not outputs
The way we measure performance should reflect the experimental approach: The focus of product development team should be on the outcome and not deliveries. If the team delivers something on time, budget and quality, but nobody wants to use it, we have wasted time and money.

A development team’s responsibility is not only to deliver code, but to run experiments to understand if something is a good idea; hereby identifying new opportunities and ultimately, ship a product that satisfy their customers’s needs.

## Different types of experiments
Running online experiments is very cheap, so running them early in a discovery process is an advantage. Run a kill experiment as fast as possible to validate your idea without getting too attached to it.

**the kill experiment** focuses on one thing only:
*Will users buy it?*

To know if customers will buy it (use it), a kill experiment must follow certain principles to work:

1. Users have to believe the product/feature exists (users cannot know they are part of an experiment).
1. Users have to commit **to buying** the product/feature (e.g., by giving their email or clicking a payment method).

Example: a simple website with minimal functionality, that mimics the full experience.

You can start with a simple proof-of-concept experiment (PoC). These types of experiments are allowed to be low fidelity; You don’t need polished a design, and it’s okay to have some friction in the user journey. The point is not to test a flashy feature or idea. The point is to see if users do what we expect them to (measuring behavior).

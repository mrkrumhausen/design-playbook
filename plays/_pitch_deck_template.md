# Brainstorm session

**Company purpose** Start here: define your company in a single declarative sentence. This is harder than it looks. It’s easy to get caught up listing features instead of communicating your mission.

Clarity of purpose Summarize the company’s business on the back of a business card.

**Problem** Describe the pain of your customer. How is this addressed today and what are the shortcomings to current solutions.

Pain killers Pick the one thing that is of burning importance to the customer, then delight them with a compelling solution.


**Solution** Explain your eureka moment. Why is your value prop unique and compelling? Why will it endure? And where does it go from here?

Focus Customers will only buy a simple product with a singular value proposition.

Think differently Constantly challenge conventional wisdom. Take the contrarian route. Create novel solutions. Outwit the competition.

Frugality Focus spending on what’s critical. Spend only on the priorities and maximize profitability.



**Why now**? The best companies almost always have a clear why now? Nature hates a vacuum—so why hasn’t your solution been built before now?

**Market potential** Identify your customer and your market. Some of the best companies invent their own markets.

Large markets Address existing markets poised for rapid growth or change. A market on the path to a $1B potential allows for error and time for real margins to develop.

Rich customers Target customers who will move fast and pay a premium for a unique offering.

**Competition / alternatives** Who are your direct and indirect competitors. Show that you have a plan to win.

**Business model** How do you intend to thrive?

**Team** Tell the story of your founders and key team members.

**Financials** If you have any, please include.

**Vision** If all goes well, what will you have built in five years?

## When to run: Are you solving the right problem?





## Why do <the play>

Not being able to articulate the actual problem makes it harder for others to understand what you are trying to accomplish. More importantly — it makes it difficult to come up with a solution that actaully solves the problem.

 

## How to frame the problem

When writing down a problem for the first time, try to include the following:

- **What** is the problem?
- **Who** experiences the problem?
- **When** does the problem occur?

“**user** has **problem** when **trigger**”.

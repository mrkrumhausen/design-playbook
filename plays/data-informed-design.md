## What is data informed design
It’s a systematic approach to the development and evolution of products and services.

## Why use a Data Informed Design Approach
Decisions for design should be informed by data

The best thing about analytics and data is that it can show us what people do on their own, but it doesn’t tell us about the users context, motivations, and intent.

## Use analytics 
Google Analytics can tell us what happens when a user comes to the pages directly. We also need to understand happens when a user comes to that page through other pages, and what happens after he takes an action to download one ebook.

### Review analytics to benchmarking the current performance

1. Page views and visits
1. Most trafficked pages
1. Traffic by type and source (organic, referral, direct, social media, keyword drivers)
1. Highest ranking SERP pages
1. Bounce and exit rates
1. Time on site
1. Content performance
1. Behavior flow
1. Conversions (subscribers, inquiries, sales, etc.)
1. Devices and browsers
1. Demographics and geographies

### Diagnose on-page behaviour
Reviewing click-tracking heatmaps and session recordings and A/B testing.

Tools like Mouseflow, Clicktale, Hotjar, VWO, and Inspectlet include click, hover, and scroll reports along with recordings of users page interactions.

## How to improve?
1. Pages that have low traffic or a high bounce rate might indicate problems with page content. Identify changes to improve the page and set a goal to increase views or engagement. 
1. Improve high traffic pages with low engagement rates. Setting goals to improve these pages will have an impact on more visitors because more people are arriving at the page.
1. NB: A high bounce rate is not necessary a bad thing, it could mean users found what they need.
1. A/B testing can then be used to compare different design versions and determine which one is more successful.

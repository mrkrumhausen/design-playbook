# The real world

### The Pigeon Methodology
Boss flies in, shits all over everything, then flies away.

### ADD (Asshole Driven Development)
An old favourite, which outlines any team where the biggest jerk makes all the big decisions. Wisdom, process and logic are not the factory default.

### NDAD (No Developers Allowed in Decisions) Methodology
Developers of all kinds are strictly forbidden when it comes to decisions regarding entire projects, from back end design to deadlines, because middle and top management know exactly what they want, how it should be done, and how long it will take.

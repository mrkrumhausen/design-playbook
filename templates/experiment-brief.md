## Experiment Brief Template
A concise document that paints a clear picture of the problem space and what we’re trying to accomplish.


## The Business Objective
Describe the business goal / problem / need / opportunity you’re 
looking to solve.
- Why is this business objective important? This is where you tie your project to the larger context of the company. 

## Hypothesis (with KPIs)
Define "Success" - How will you know that you’ve succeeded?

*e.g. adding a buy button next to the product will increase conversion by 20%*

**Considerations**:
- Who are we solving for?
- List metrics and goals that measure the success of the feature.

## Experiment design
Description of the solution/implementation.
- What's in / out of scope?

**Considerations**:
- Who needs to be involved?
- What problems do we need to solve? Identify unknowns, areas of risk, and known challenges that need to be resolved before development can begin.
- What is already built? A short description of existing and related features that give context to the new project.
- What future considerations need to be accounted for? Are there future features or business goals that will build on top of this feature? Goal is to not design ourselves into a corner now if we know about something in the future.

List the results.

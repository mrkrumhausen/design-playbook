This is my design playbook. It details how I create successful products, and also how I run my practise. It's based on my own  and study of others' experiences.

It is a living document that I encourage everyone to contribute to using a [public GitHub repo](https://github.com/mrkrumhausen/design-playbook).

Iâ€™ve made the playbook free and licensed it as Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial so you may learn use it as you please. While my "plays" have worked for me, I trust you to decide which tools and techniques might work for you, too.

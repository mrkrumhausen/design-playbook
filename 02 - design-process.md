# User-Centric Product Design Lifecycle
a high level process combining user-centered design principles with agile and scrum methodologies. Following this process will ensure that the product meets both user and stakeholder requirements. The 5 pillars of this process are:

1. Strategy
1. Discovery
1. Analysis
1. Design
1. Production


**User Involvement**
Following the learn, build, test methodology stakeholders and users are heavily involved in the beginning during the strategy and discovery phases when building empathy and understanding is the focus. During the design and production phases we are following more of a QA model in eliciting direct feedback from users.


## Strategy
Stakeholder Discussions

Especially in an enterprise setting, the stakeholder often commissions a project to create a product to solve a perceived problem.

Project Vision/Goals
The stakeholder will have a “vision” to execute a solution for a perceived problem. This vision will often drive priority of the roadmap release schedule. The problem statement / product story is defined here to help focus the scope of the product and what challenges it will look to solve.

Brand Strategy
Branding can play as big a role as user experience and functionality. The product must fit into an overall brand strategy (marketing analysis). This can include what integrations are targeted to using the same typography and color palette.

Measure of Success
Defining success at the onset w/ stakeholders buy-in is crucial so that everyone both inside and outside of the product team can measure if they have been successful. It’s important that the goal posts be set at the onset and not change.

- KPIs

Project Priority
Determining which aspects of a product should be prioritized over others. This should guide the project manager in designing the release schedule and what features to work on when.





## Discovery
Business Requirements

This is traditionally what is used to drive product development. These requirements help establish acceptance criteria later on in the process. These are the “must-have” aspects of the product.
“We must begin digital projects by exploring and pinpointing the needs of the people who will use the service, and the ways the service will fit into their lives. Whether the users are members of the public or government employees, policy makers must include real people in their design process from the beginning. The needs of people — not constraints of government structures or silos — should inform technical and design decisions. We need to continually test the products we build with real people to keep us honest about what is important.” — via U.S. Digital Services Playbook

Analytics Review
How often are users competing tasks? How many users use a particular system? How many tasks are they processing? Obtaining analytical data about users helps understand what they are doing.

Content Audit
Understanding the data users are utilizing during their tasks helps for user defined acceptance criteria. If specific types of data are used it’s important to understand this so you make sure to include that in your product.

User Interviews
Contextual user interviews help understand why users take specific actions. This is the most qualitative event and provides a trough of information about user behavior. It also helps define user processes, tasks, and personas.

Surveys
Theses are great if you need quick responses to quantitative information.

User Testing
This can be done during the interviews but doing some sort of testing on the user’s existing products can help you improve your product by avoiding the pitfalls the current software falls into.


## Analysis
Use Cases
These are often situational understandings of a particular user action. Nowadays these are written as user stories, encapsulating the persona, action, and motivation of the task.
Persona Creation
A persona is an document that contains the analysis of qualitative and quantitative information about a identified meta-person. Personas are made up of groups of real people who identify with a particular role. Each persona has their own goals, tasks, and motivations.
Story Boards
Storyboards help understand user stories in a visual way. They are created at specific situations or use cases.
Experience Map
An experience map They can help organize user stories in a logical way that enables product teams to quickly and efficiently build products.
Workflow Diagram
When trying to map a product flow to a user’s processes, workflow diagrams are essential in understanding when to present information to the user.
Design
Mood Board
Much in the vein of Pinterest, mood boards are “yes, and…” exercise where designers will collect colors, typography, existing products, etc to form a basis for the overall look, feel, and function of the product.
Site Map
A site map visually shows the steps a user could take to navigate a product, this is analogous with information architecture.
Sketching
Jotting down general ideas in a notebook or on a whiteboard is the free-form exercise designers can perform to get a general idea of concepts that could be used in the design of a product.
Wireframing
The next level up in fidelity from sketching, wireframing takes into account the device constraints and dimensions on a whiteboard or a program like balsamiq creating very low fidelity mock ups for what a real design could mimic.
Prototyping
Using the wireframes as a basis, prototyping is where the designer creates “good enough” products.
User Testing
Using the wireframes or prototypes, designer show users what they’ve come up with in a short amount of time. Users are able to physically interact with the product but no actual code or data is present. This instant feedback look avoids expensive development effort to make sure when the product is built, very little changes would need to be made.


## Production
Prototyping
Prototypes at this point have been thoroughly vetted in the previous step so they should be much more fully formed and tested with a users outside the initial pilot group.
Beta Launch / MVP
This is when a minimum viable product (MVP) gets deployed to a set of pilot users. The product should be thoroughly QA’d from both a design and development standpoint.
User Testing
Testing with the pilot user group, and more if possible, should be stringent using testing plans to make sure all use cases are thoroughly tested and functionality has no errors.
Release / Launch
The big day has come to deploy your release! User behavior should be closely watched using analytics and contact with users should be higher than usual to make sure the product is fully functional.

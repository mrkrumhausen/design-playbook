title: Objective based product development
---

# Objective based product development
Management will provide the overall objective for each quarter - OKR. The objective is outcome based (e.g. increase leads or increase retention) rather than delivery based (e.g. build a specific feature). 

NB: *Outcome-based objectives are fundamental to Dual-Track Agile product development*.

## What is the Product Space ðŸš€
A library of product management advice from different frameworks, blog posts, resources, books, products, and much more.

## Why playbook
In American football, the situation on the field changes all the time. Itâ€™s impossible for a team to plan all their moves in advanceâ€Šâ€”â€Šthey have no clue how things are going to unfold. To cope with this uncertainty, teams use so-called playbooks which contain the teamâ€™s strategies and plays.

The playbook contains hundreds of plays which worked well in the past and can help the team win the game.

## What is a play
A play is an agreed upon set of actions the team takes in a given situation. It helps to have a shared understanding and a shared language, so everyone is on the same page.

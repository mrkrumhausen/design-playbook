## What is the Product Space ðŸš€
The product space is a playbook of product management techniques and best practises. It consists of plays gathered from different sources incl. frameworks, talks, blog posts, resources and books.

## What is a playbook?
In American football, the situation on the field changes all the time. Itâ€™s impossible for a team to plan all their moves in advanceâ€Šâ€”â€Šthey have no clue how things are going to unfold. To cope with this uncertainty, teams use so-called playbooks which contain the teamâ€™s strategies and plays.

## What is a play
A play is an agreed upon set of actions the product team can choose in a given situation. It helps to have a shared understanding and a shared language, so everyone is on the same page.

## Why a playbook and not a process?
Design and innovation teams need to know when to apply the right methodsâ€”but canâ€™t be forced into a linear process

Tools, guidance, and structure are an integral part of a systematic and repeatable approach, but overly prescribed processes restrict creativity. Being too rigid about the timing or order of certain phases can quickly squash team engagement. If the phases are quick, teams may contribute too superficially; too long and teams lose momentum.

Instead teams thrives with just enough structure to help them know that things are going according to plan, where they can still customize the process and get feedback along the way.

> *Donâ€™t focus on a single, linear process. Empower your team to use the right approach and tool at the right time, and document them clearly.*

<p class="fs-6 fw-300">You should run experiments to assess the value of an idea. An idea often comes as a solution to a userâ€™s pain/need.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-run">When to run</h2>

<h2 id="why">Why</h2>

<h2 id="the-experimental-approach">The experimental approach</h2>
<p>In the experimental approach, we try to run simple experiments as fast as possible in order to learn if something is a good idea. Here the focus is on testing / failing fast</p>

<p><em>1 Idea &gt; 2 Measure (experiment) &gt; 3 Decision &gt; 4 then Build</em></p>

<p>When you have run the experiment and gained knowledge about an idea, it is time to make a decision based on evidence.</p>

<!-- ## Focus on outcomes, not outputs
The way we measure performance should reflect the experimental approach: The focus of product development team should be on the outcome and not deliveries. If the team delivers something on time, budget and quality, but nobody wants to use it, we have wasted time and money.

A development teamâ€™s responsibility is not only to deliver code, but to run experiments to understand if something is a good idea; hereby identifying new opportunities and ultimately, ship a product that satisfy their customersâ€™s needs. -->

<h2 id="how-to-experiment">How to experiment</h2>
<p>Think like a scientist. Treat each experiment as an opportunity to learn what is and is not working. Designing a good experiment is key. It should have:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A clear, falsifiable hypothesis</li>
  <li>An obvious next action</li>
  <li>Strict risk containment</li>
  <li>A tie between what is measured and at least one leap of faith assumption</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="different-types-of-experiments">Different types of experiments</h2>
<p>Running online experiments is very cheap, so running them early in a discovery process is an advantage. Run a kill experiment as fast as possible to validate your idea without getting too attached to it.</p>

<h3 id="will-users-buy-it">Will users buy it?</h3>
<p>This experiment focuses on one thing only: <em>Will users buy it?</em></p>

<p>To know if customers will buy it (use it), the experiment must follow certain principles to work:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Users have to believe the product/feature exists (users cannot know they are part of an experiment).</li>
  <li>Users have to commit <strong>to buying</strong> the product/feature (e.g., by giving their email or clicking a payment method).</li>
</ol>

<p>Example: a simple website with minimal functionality, that mimics the full experience.</p>

<p>You can start with a simple proof-of-concept experiment (PoC). These types of experiments are allowed to be low fidelity; You donâ€™t need polished a design, and itâ€™s okay to have some friction in the user journey. The point is not to test a flashy feature or idea. The point is to see if users do what we expect them to (measuring behavior).</p>

<h3 id="fake-door">Fake door</h3>
<p>Build the door for the feature without actually building the feature and measure the interest. If enought users click (engage) then itâ€™s worth building the feature.</p>

<h3 id="ab-or-split-testing">A/B or split testing</h3>
<p>The regular version of a product (called Control) is compared against a modified version (the B Variant or the Challenger) and checked for effects on a companyâ€™s guiding metrics (or Overall Evaluation Criteria, OEC). Test with a small percentage of users, usually 1-5%</p>

<p><strong>Pro tip</strong>: a couple of bigger tech companies have open sourced their internal systems for others to use. See Clouderaâ€™sÂ <a href="https://github.com/cloudera/gertrude">Gertrude</a>, Etsyâ€™sÂ <a href="https://github.com/etsy/feature">Feature</a>, and Facebookâ€™sÂ <a href="http://facebook.github.io/planout/">PlanOut</a>, for example.</p>

<h2 id="concluding-notes">Concluding notes</h2>
<p>Experimentation is typically run when teams have enough traffic to empirically and scientifically test whether a change will produce the intended effects with a cohort of real users. Teams using experimentation should ensure they have adequate levels of traffic, they understand the problem they are trying to solve and they have ensured the impact of their changes can and should be measured through an experiment.</p>

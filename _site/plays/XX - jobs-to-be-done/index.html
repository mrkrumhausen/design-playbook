<h1 id="jobs-to-be-done">Jobs to be done</h1>
<p><em>Jobs-to-be-done (JTBD) is a framework based on the idea that whenever users “hire” (i.e., use) a product, they do it for a specific “job” (i.e., to achieve a particular outcome).</em></p>

<p>Rather than focusing on a list of features for a product, the JTBD framework forces designers to think about outcomes. It helps you understand that customers don’t buy products and services; they hire various solutions at various times to get a wide array of jobs done.</p>

<p>When you see customers piecing together solutions themselves, these are great clues for innovation.</p>

<h3 id="what-isnt-a-job-to-be-done">What isn’t a Job to be Done</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A big mistake is thinking of a Job to be Done as an activity or task. Examples include <em>store and retrieve music</em> or <em>listen to music</em>. These are not Jobs; rather, they are tasks and activities — which means they describe how you use a product or what you do with it</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-better-me">a better me</h3>
<p>Instead a Job to be Done describe the “better me.” It answers the question, “How are you better since you started using [product]?”</p>

<p><em>Upgrade your user, not your product. Don’t build better cameras — build better photographers</em>.</p>

<p>Customers don’t want your product or what it does; they want help making themselves better (i.e., they want to evolve, make progress).</p>

<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
<p><em>Free me from the stress I deal with when figuring out what products won’t harm my children so I can have more time to enjoy being a parent</em>.</p>

<p>Note the two parts: (1) the Job, (2) when the job is done</p>

<p>The emphasis on a struggle for progress is why this JTBD model often makes use of phrases such as give me, help me, make the, take away, free me, or equip me. These phrases remind us that success comes from the customers using the product to make progress. It also helps you think about how your product fits in between where they are now and where they want to be.</p>

<p>All about context and causality.</p>
